================================================================================

Dear CN7021 Students,
I hope you are well and ready to begin the CN7021 software solution project work. The Module Assignment Brief (Coursework Guide), the group assignment report template, and your group allocation details are now available on the CN7021 module Moodle site. Please locate your group assignment and membership via Moodle → Participants → Filter by Groups and download the coursework guide and the project report template from the Assessment & Feedback section. Everyone should already be assigned to a group and must be prepared to start work on the software solution project immediately.
Important: group allocations are final and cannot be changed. If you believe there is an administrative error (e.g., you are not assigned to any group), contact your tutor or me immediately, but requests to swap groups will not be accepted. All information about deliverables, submission format (report template, word limits), marking criteria and deadlines is contained in the Module Assignment Brief, so please read that document carefully before asking routine questions. Further guidance and task breakdowns will be provided in our upcoming lab sessions, attendance and active participation are essential.
Remember to work collaboratively, observe the university’s academic conduct guidelines, and keep your project work and version-control evidence up to date (e.g., GitHub/GitLab). If you have any issues or need clarification after reading the brief, contact your tutor or me.
Wishing you a productive start to the software solution project.
Kind regards,
Hisham
