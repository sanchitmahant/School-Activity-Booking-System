Description: Decided to build School Activity Booking System from scratch using Python Flask.
Detailed Presentation Script (Read this for Viva/Questions): We deliberately chose to build this application from scratch using the Python Flask micro-framework rather than using a heavyweight framework like Django or a CMS. This decision was driven by the need for granular control over the application architecture, allowing us to implement advanced software engineering patterns such as the Application Factory Pattern, MVC architecture, and custom Role-Based Access Control. Flask's lightweight nature enabled us to maintain a modular codebase where each component serves a specific purpose, demonstrating our understanding of the Separation of Concerns principle.

End Date: 2025-10-28
Assignee: Mohd Sharjeel
Status: Done
Description: Conducted comprehensive requirements gathering for three user personas.
Detailed Presentation Script (Read this for Viva/Questions): We performed thorough Requirements Engineering, identifying three distinct user personas: Parent (books activities for children), Tutor (manages classes and attendance), and Administrator (manages entire system). We employed User Story mapping for each persona, such as 'As a Parent, I need calendar invites for bookings so I don't forget my child's activities' and 'As an Admin, I need COCOMO metrics to understand project cost.' This requirements analysis revealed critical features missing in existing systems, including automated waitlist management, professional email notifications with .ics attachments, and comprehensive PDF invoicing.

Name: Phase 2: Architecture & Database Design
Start Date: 2025-10-28
End Date: 2025-11-03
Assignee: Chichebendu Blessed Umeh
Status: Done
Description: Designed system architecture using MVC pattern and normalized database schema.
Detailed Presentation Script (Read this for Viva/Questions): We architected the system following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern to ensure strict Separation of Concerns. Models (SQLAlchemy classes in app.py) encapsulate all business logic and data validation. Views (Jinja2 templates in templates/) handle presentation with zero business logic. Controllers (Flask route functions) orchestrate request handling and response generation. This architecture enables independent modification of any layer without cascading effectsΓÇöcritical for long-term maintainability and team collaboration.

--- Row 4 ---
Name: Database Schema Design (3NF)
Start Date: 2025-10-28
End Date: 2025-11-03
Assignee: Shiva Kasula
Status: Done
Description: Created normalized database with 7 models following Third Normal Form.
Detailed Presentation Script (Read this for Viva/Questions): We designed a database schema strictly adhering to Third Normal Form (3NF) to eliminate redundancy and ensure data integrity. Our schema includes 7 interconnected models: Parent, Child, Activity, Booking, Tutor, Admin, and Waitlist. Each relationship is carefully mappedΓÇöfor example, we implemented a One-to-Many relationship from Parent to Child (one parent, many children) and from Activity to Booking. We avoid data duplication by using Foreign Keys; for instance, storing child_id in Booking rather than duplicating child data. This normalization ensures that updating a Child's name propagates automatically across all bookings, preventing database inconsistencies.

Name: Security Architecture
Start Date: 2025-11-03
End Date: 2025-11-05
Assignee: Sanchit Kaushal
Status: Done
Description: Implemented comprehensive security layer with CSRF protection and password hashing.
Detailed Presentation Script (Read this for Viva/Questions): Security was our primary concern from inception. We implemented multiple security layers: (1) Password Security using Werkzeug's generate_password_hash which employs the Scrypt algorithm, a memory-hard key derivation function resistant to GPU-based brute-force attacks. (2) CSRF Protection via Flask-WTF, generating unique tokens for each form submission to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks. (3) Session Security using Flask's cryptographically signed cookies that prevent tampering. (4) Authorization Decorators that enforce Role-Based Access Control, ensuring parents cannot access admin routes and vice versa. (5) SQL Injection Prevention through SQLAlchemy's parameterized queries.

Name: UI/UX Design System
Start Date: 2025-11-04
End Date: 2025-11-10
Assignee: Mohd Sharjeel
Status: Done
Description: Developed professional design system with accessible, responsive interface.
Detailed Presentation Script (Read this for Viva/Questions): We created a comprehensive 'Modern Academic' Design System ensuring professional aesthetics and accessibility. Color Palette: Deep Navy (#002E5D) for trust and Teal (#0DA49F) for energy, chosen after analyzing educational institution design patterns. Typography: Inter for headings (geometric, modern) and Roboto for body text (highly readable). We utilized Bootstrap 5's responsive grid system ensuring mobile compatibility, overlaid with custom CSS implementing glassmorphism effects for depth. Accessibility was paramountΓÇöwe ensured WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with high contrast ratios (minimum 4.5:1), descriptive ARIA labels, and keyboard navigation support.

Name: Phase 3: Core Authentication System
Start Date: 2025-11-11
End Date: 2025-11-17
Assignee: Chichebendu Blessed Umeh
Status: Done
Description: Built robust authentication with registration, login, and session management.
Detailed Presentation Script (Read this for Viva/Questions): We engineered a custom authentication system demonstrating deep understanding of web security. The Registration flow validates email uniqueness through database queries, enforces password complexity client-side, and hashes passwords using Scrypt before storage. The Login mechanism queries the database for the email, verifies the password using constant-time comparison (preventing timing attacks), and creates a server-side session. We implemented the Application Factory Pattern (create_app()) allowing multiple app instances with different configurationsΓÇöcritical for testing environments. Each route is protected by custom decorators (@login_required, @admin_required, @tutor_required) that verify session validity before granting access.

--- Row 8 ---
Name: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Start Date: 2025-11-11
End Date: 2025-11-14
Assignee: Shiva Kasula
Status: Done
Description: Implemented decorator-based RBAC for three user types with separate portals.
Detailed Presentation Script (Read this for Viva/Questions): We implemented sophisticated Role-Based Access Control using Python decorators, demonstrating advanced software engineering. Three separate decorators enforce access: @login_required (for parents), @admin_required, and @tutor_required. Each decorator wraps route functions, checking session variables before execution and returning 403 Forbidden for unauthorized access. This is superior to inline checks because decorators are reusable, testable, and follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. We created three distinct portal entry points (/login, /admin/login, /tutor/login), each with isolated dashboards, ensuring complete separation of concerns between user types.

--- Row 9 ---
Name: Parent Portal Development
Start Date: 2025-11-15
End Date: 2025-11-21
Assignee: Sanchit Kaushal
Status: Done
Description: Created comprehensive parent dashboard with booking management.
Detailed Presentation Script (Read this for Viva/Questions): The Parent Portal is the primary user interface, implementing Server-Side Rendering (SSR) with Jinja2 templates for optimal performance and SEO. Key features: (1) Dynamic Dashboard displaying children and their bookings using database joins to minimize queries. (2) AJAX-powered 'Add Child' modal providing seamless UX without page reloads. (3) Activity Browsing with real-time availability indicatorsΓÇöwe calculate available spots by subtracting confirmed bookings from max capacity, displayed with color-coded badges (green: available, orange: filling, red: full). (4) Progress Bars showing enrollment percentage with responsive color changes. (5) Booking Sidebar listing all confirmed bookings with status indicators.

Name: Phase 4: Advanced Booking Engine
Start Date: 2025-11-18
End Date: 2025-11-24
Assignee: Mohd Sharjeel
Status: Done
Description: Developed sophisticated booking system with conflict detection and capacity management.
Detailed Presentation Script (Read this for Viva/Questions): The Booking Engine represents the core technical complexity, implementing multi-layer validation within database transactions. Validation Pipeline: (1) Input Sanitization checking data types and ranges. (2) Authorization Verification ensuring parent owns the child. (3) Temporal Conflict Detection querying for existing bookings on the same date for the same child. (4) Capacity Verification counting confirmed bookings versus max capacity. (5) Transaction Management wrapping the entire operation in db.session to ensure ACID properties. If any check fails, the transaction rolls back, preventing invalid state. We handle both standard form submissions and AJAX requests, returning appropriate responses (redirects vs JSON) based on request headers.

Name: Database Transaction Management
Start Date: 2025-11-18
End Date: 2025-11-19
Assignee: Chichebendu Blessed Umeh
Status: Done
Description: Implemented ACID-compliant transactions to prevent race conditions.
Detailed Presentation Script (Read this for Viva/Questions): To prevent race conditions where multiple users book the last slot simultaneously, we implemented ACID-compliant database transactions. Each booking operation follows: (1) Begin implicit transaction with db.session.add(). (2) Perform all validation checks within this transaction context. (3) If all checks pass, commit with db.session.commit(). (4) If any check fails or exception occurs, trigger rollback restoring database to previous state. This ensures Atomicity (operation is all-or-nothing), Consistency (database constraints are maintained), Isolation (concurrent transactions don't interfere), and Durability (committed changes persist). We also implemented Optimistic Locking for the waitlist system.

--- Row 12 ---
Name: Waitlist System (Automated)
Start Date: 2025-11-20
End Date: 2025-11-22
Assignee: Shiva Kasula
Status: Done
Description: Built intelligent automated waitlist with automatic promotion mechanism.
Detailed Presentation Script (Read this for Viva/Questions): We engineered an automated waitlist system demonstrating advanced algorithmic thinking. When activity capacity is reached, users are offered waitlist placement. Our algorithm: (1) Create Waitlist entry with timestamp and status='waiting'. (2) On booking cancellation, trigger check_waitlist_and_promote() function. (3) Query Waitlist table filtering by activity_id AND request_date AND status='waiting'. (4) Order results by created_at ascending (FIFO queue). (5) Select first entry using first(). (6) Atomically create new Booking, update Waitlist status to 'promoted', and commit transaction. This automatic promotion eliminates manual intervention and ensures fairness. We would enhance this with email notifications in production.

Status: Done
Description: Developed secure payment simulation with state machine approach.
Detailed Presentation Script (Read this for Viva/Questions): We implemented a realistic Payment Simulation using the State Machine pattern, mimicking real-world e-commerce systems. Flow: (1) User selects activity and date ΓåÆ State: 'Selection'. (2) System validates and redirects to payment page ΓåÆ State: 'Pending Payment'. (3) Payment form captures card details (simulated) with client-side validation. (4) On submission, system creates Booking with status='confirmed' and cost=activity.price ΓåÆ State: 'Confirmed'. (5) Redirect to confirmation page. This mimics the Two-Phase Commit protocol used by Stripe/PayPal where monetary transaction and order confirmation are separate operations. In production, we would integrate with a payment gateway API and implement webhook handlers for asynchronous payment confirmation.

Name: Calendar Integration (.ics Files)
Start Date: 2025-11-27
End Date: 2025-11-28
Assignee: Shiva Kasula
Status: Done
Description: Implemented iCalendar standard for automated calendar addition.
Detailed Presentation Script (Read this for Viva/Questions): We implemented the iCalendar (RFC 5545) standard to generate .ics files, demonstrating our ability to work with industry protocols. Our generate_ics_file() function: (1) Parses activity start_time and end_time strings. (2) Combines with booking_date to create datetime objects. (3) Formats as iCalendar DTSTART and DTEND (YYYYMMDDTHHmmss format). (4) Constructs .ics file content following RFC specification including VCALENDAR wrapper, VEVENT properties, VALARM for 24-hour reminders, and ORGANIZER field. (5) Attaches to email as text/calendar MIME type. When users receive the email, clicking the .ics file adds the activity to their calendar (Google Calendar, Outlook, Apple Calendar) with automatic remindersΓÇöa feature typically seen only in commercial booking systems.
